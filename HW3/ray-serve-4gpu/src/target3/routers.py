"""Group D: prefix-affinity-first routing with load-aware spillover.

Signals (current request + current service state only):
  - session id of the pending request (== the workload's prefix family id)
  - current in-flight count per replica (the maximum of router lifecycle-hook
    counts and the replica's record_routing_stats report, which spans proxies)
  - each replica's configured max_ongoing_requests

Rule:
  1. Primary replica = stable blake2b hash of the session id, so requests of
     one prefix family stick to one replica and reuse its RadixCache.
  2. If the primary's in-flight count < hot_fraction * max_ongoing_requests
     (hot_fraction defaults to 0.5), return [[primary]]: strict prefix affinity.
  3. Otherwise the primary is hot: return a single rank [[spill, primary]],
     where spill is the currently least-loaded other replica. Serve probes both
     in that rank and picks the shorter queue, so hot-family requests overflow
     to a cooler replica. (Returning them as separate ranks makes Serve try them
     one at a time, which stalled the proxy under load; see README.)
